    <h3 class="is-size-4">2024 • Back to My Roots</h3>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Senior Software Engineer</p>

        <p>After spending time in product management and leadership, I decided it was time to return to my core 
            passion: software engineering. I joined EA Respawn as a build &amp; release engineer on Apex
            Legends so I could continue to expand my knowledge into new domains beyond web and online services,
            while remaining true to my core passion of supporting live service AAA games.

        <p>Building on the previous decade’s experience in leading individual teams, the natural evolution and latest
            phase of my career is to build out multiple teams and products for large scale initiatives.</p>
        <p>I’ve also continued to hone my product management skills and inform
            product decisions with data analysis, business acumen, and development experience to build products that
            are valuable, viable, feasible, and usable.
